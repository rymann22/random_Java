- These are called short circuit evaluations
- They read from left to right in something like an if statement
- Simple explination
  - if condition 1 is true && condition 2 is true
    - run this code
  - else, run this
- Operators
- && - both conditions need to be true to run
- || - runs if either condition one, condition two, or both conditions are true

Workflow
x = 5; // set value of x to 5
// check if condition 1 is true
if (( x > 0 ) && (x < 10)) {
  System.out.println('x is greater than 0 and less than 10');
} else {
  System.out.println('x is not greater than 0 or less than 10');
}

1. condition 1: ( x > 0 ) 
2. and/or: && 
3. condition 2: (x < 10)
