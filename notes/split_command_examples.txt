This will cover split and briefly touch on arrays

The lines below is using the "split" command 
- String fullName = scanner.nextLine().trim();
  - ".trim()" is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace
- String[] nameParts = fullName.split("\\s+");

Breakdown
- String[]
  - This indicates that the variable will be a string, and the square brackets will assign the "parts" to an array
  - If the input is Peter Parker it will basically mean this
    - {"Peter", "Parker"}
    - Peter will be at index 0, or nameParts[0]
    - Parker will be at index 1, or nameParts[1]
- nameParts
  - the variable name
- fullName.split("\\s+");
  - takes the variable "fullName" and splits it
  - ("\\s+") 
    - regular expression
    - \\s matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline)
    - + means one or more of preceding element
